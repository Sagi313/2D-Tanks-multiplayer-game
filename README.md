A multiplayer game I built using python

A preview for the next version-

![alt Preview](https://i.ibb.co/R0qnjwH/preview-img.jpg)

Libraries used:
- Pygame
- Pickle
- Sockets
- Threading

This is a current project I am working on right now.

# How to run the game
- Run the Server.py
- Run the Client.py in the client side

This will have a login system. The login system uses MySQL
on the server.
The server code is running on my Raspberry Pi Zero W.
The server is currently off.
